# Workspace Opener #

This Python app is designed to show all Visual Studio workspaces in a hard drive/folder and let the user choose which one to open.

At the moment its in very very early stages of development but I'll add to it when I can.

## Installation ##

There isn't really much to run at the moment, however here are the Python instructions nevertheless.

_Unfortunately this will only work on Mac ATM_

1. Install Python 2.7
2. Navigatate to folder
3. Change folder in filelist.py folder
4. Run program with the following command: `python mainprogram.py`
